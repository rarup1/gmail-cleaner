# gmail-cleaner
A very quick and dirty clean up of google mail inbox using the IMAP protocol python library.

The searches are designed for Gmail but the code can easily be adapted for another mail box.

## To run

Update the config in main.py to use your personal

`python main.py`

The prompt will ask you if you wish to continue with deletion.
